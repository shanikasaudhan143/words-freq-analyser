This project is a Word Frequency Analyzer built with a React frontend and an Express backend. It fetches webpage content from a given URL, processes the visible text to calculate word frequency, and displays the top 'N' most frequent words in a table.

**Features**
-> Accepts a URL and the number of top frequent words (N) as inputs.
-> Retrieves visible content from the provided webpage URL.
-> Calculates the frequency of each word and displays the top 'N' most frequent words.
-> User-friendly interface with responsive design.

Frontend: React, Axios, CSS
Backend: Express.js, Puppeteer, CORS
Package Manager: npm

Troubleshooting
CORS Error: Ensure that the backend server is running on http://localhost:5000 and that CORS is correctly set up.
404 Not Found: Double-check the /api/frequencies endpoint in the frontend to ensure it matches the backend route.
Puppeteer Issues: If Puppeteer fails, try reinstalling it or using the latest version.
